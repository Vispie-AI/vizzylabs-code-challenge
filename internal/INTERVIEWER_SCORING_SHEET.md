## Evaluation Philosophy

These challenges test **DECISION-MAKING**, not bug-fixing.

The code works. There are no bugs to find.
We evaluate how candidates approach business problems with AI assistance.

**Key Question: Did they direct AI, or did AI direct them?**

| 23-25 | Asked 4+ questions, understood constraints, identified trade-offs |
| 18-22 | Asked 2-3 good questions, reasonable understanding |
| 12-17 | Asked 1 question, moved to coding quickly |
| 6-11 | Briefly read README, went straight to AI/code |
| 0-5 | No investigation, immediately asked AI "what's wrong?" |

**Score: ___/25**
